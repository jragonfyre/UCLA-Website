{: .definition .math-quote }
&gt; **Definition 1**{: .math-header } 
&gt; A category $$\uln{\calC}$$ enriched over $$\calV$$ (or a $$\calV$$-category for short)
&gt; consists of the data 
&gt; of 
&gt; 
&gt; 1. a collection of objects $$\calC_0$$, 
&gt; 2. for each pair of objects $$x,y\in\calC_0$$
&gt;    an object $$\uln{\calC}(x,y)$$ of $$\calV,$$
&gt; 3. for each triple of objects $$x,y,z\in\calC_0,$$ a morphism in $$\calV$$
&gt;    $$\circ_{x,y,z} : \uln{\calC}(y,z)\otimes\uln{\calC}(x,y) \to \uln{\calC}(x,z),$$
&gt; 4. and for each object $$x\in\calC_0$$ a 
&gt;    $$\calV$$-morphism $$\iota_x : 1_\calV \to \uln{\calC}(x,x)$$ such that 
&gt; 
&gt; the composition is associative and unital in the sense of satisfying
&gt; appropriate coherence conditions.

It turns out that this is equivalent to specifying the following alternate data

{: .definition .math-quote }
&gt; **Definition 2**{: .math-header } 
&gt; A category $$\uln{\calC}$$ enriched over $$\calV$$ (or a $$\calV$$-category for short)
&gt; consists of the data 
&gt; of 
&gt; 
&gt; 1. an ordinary category $$\calC$$, and 
&gt; 2. a bifunctor $$\uln{\calC}:\calC^\op\times\calC\to \calV,$$ 
&gt; 3. an extranatural transformation
&gt;    $$\circ_{x,y,z} : \uln{\calC}(y,z)\otimes\uln{\calC}(x,y) \to \uln{\calC}(x,z),$$
&gt;    or equivalently a natural transformation 
&gt;    
&gt;    $$\circ : \int^{y\in\calC} \uln{\calC}(y,z)\otimes\uln{\calC}(x,y)\to \uln{\calC}(x,z),$$
&gt;    
&gt;    assuming the coend exists in $$\calV,$$
&gt; 4. and for each object $$x\in\calC_0$$ a 
&gt;    $$\calV$$-morphism $$\iota_x : 1_\calV \to \uln{\calC}(x,x)$$ such that 
&gt; 
&gt; the composition is associative and unital in the sense of satisfying
&gt; appropriate coherence conditions, and 
&gt; the maps $$\calC(x,y)\to\calV(1_\calV,\uln{\calC}(x,y))$$ given by 
&gt; $$f\mapsto f^* \circ \iota_y$$ and $$f\mapsto f_* \circ \iota_x$$ are 
&gt; bijections.

The first definition prioritizes enriched categories as separate from ordinary 
categories. The second focuses on enriched categories as additional structure on 
ordinary categories. The equivalence is given by the fact that an enriched category
$$\uln{\calC}$$
in the first sense has an underlying ordinary category $$\calC$$ whose hom sets are 
given by $$\calC(x,y):=\calV(1_\calV,\uln{\calC}(x,y))$$. The maps $$\iota_x$$
are then the identities in the underlying category.

Given an enriched category then, we can consider the functor 
$$\calV(-,\uln{\calC}(-,-)) : \calV^\op\times\calC^\op\times \calC\to \Set.$$
Essentially we have taken the Yoneda embedding of the enriched category structure.

Suppose that we have a generic such functor, $$A:\calV^\op\times\calC^\op\times\calC\to \Set.$$
What conditions can we impose on it such that when the functors $$A(-,x,y)$$ are representable for 
all $$x$$ and $$y$$ the representing objects form an enriched category structure which has $$A$$ as its 
Yoneda embedding?

Well, first of all, we have distinguished elements $$\iota_x\in A(1_\calV,x,x)$$ for all $$x\in\calC,$$
which are the identity elements. In fact, in order for this to be the data of an enriched category whose 
underlying category is $$\calC,$$ we need a natural isomorphism 
$$\calC(-,-)\simeq A(1_\calV,-,-),$$
with $$1_x$$ corresponding to $$\iota_x.$$

In addition,
we have a composition extranatural transformation
$$\circ : A(v,y,z)\times A(u,x,y)\to A(v\otimes u,x,z),$$
which for a functor coming from an enriched category is given by tensoring the maps together and 
composing with the composition of the enriched category. The composition should be associative, and 
the units and the composition should be compatible in the sense 
that 
$$\iota_y \circ f = f = f\circ \iota_x$$ 
modulo the unit isomorphisms of $$\calV.$$

Now suppose the functors $$A(-,x,y)$$ are all representable. Can we recover the composition of 
$$\uln{\calC}$$ when $$A$$ comes from $$\uln{\calC}$$? 
Let $$(\uln{\calC}(x,y),\alpha_{x,y})$$ represent $$A(-,x,y).$$
Then 

$$\alpha_{y,z}\circ \alpha_{x,y} \in A(\uln{\calC}(y,z)\otimes \uln{\calC}(x,y),x,z)$$

corresponds to some map 

$$\circ_{x,y,z} : \uln{\calC}(y,z)\otimes\uln{\calC}(x,y)\to\uln{\calC}(x,z)$$

such that $$\alpha_{y,z}\circ \alpha_{x,y} = \circ_{x,y,z}^*\alpha_{x,z}.$$
We can use this condition to show that this recovered composition is associative and 
unital, and its not hard to check that this recovered composition will be the same 
as the original composition in the case that $$A$$ came from an enriched category.

As a result, we have the following conclusion:

{: .proposition .math-quote }
&gt; **Definition/Proposition 3**{: .math-header } 
&gt; If $$\calC$$ is an ordinary category, $$\calV$$ is a monoidal category, then 
&gt; a *preenrichment* of $$\calC$$ over $$\calV$$ is the data of 
&gt; 
&gt; 1. A functor $$A:\calV^\op\times\calC^\op\times\calC\to \Set,$$
&gt; 2. a natural isomorphism $$\calC(-,-)\simeq A(1_\calV,-,-),$$
&gt; 3. an extranatural transformation 
&gt;    
&gt;    $$ \circ : A(v,y,z)\otimes A(u,x,y) \to A(v\otimes u, x,z)$$
&gt; 
&gt; such that $$\circ$$ is associative and unital in the sense discussed above.
&gt; 
&gt; Then as a result of the discussion above, $$A$$ describes an enrichment of 
&gt; $$\calC$$ over $$\calV$$ if and only the functors 
&gt; $$A(-,x,y)$$ are representable for all $$x$$ and $$y$$ in $$\calC.$$ 
&gt; Similarly $$A$$ describes a $$\calV$$-module structure on $$\calC$$ 
&gt; if and only if the functors $$A(v,x,-)$$ are representable for all 
&gt; $$v\in\calV$$ and $$x\in\calC$$, and $$A$$ describes a $$\calV$$-cotensor
&gt; structure on $$\calC$$ if and only if the functors 
&gt; $$A(v,-,y)$$ are representable for all $$v\in\calV$$ and $$y\in\calC$$.
&gt; 
&gt; When we have a Day convolution on presheaves on $$\calV,$$ (I think we need 
&gt; to assume that $$\calV$$ is small), then this is equivalent to
&gt; the data of an enriching 
&gt; of $$\calC$$ in presheaves on $$\calV$$ with Day convolution. 

All of this seems to come from the profunctor point of view, which seems to have 
the advantage that we don't have to assume that anything is representable.
Solutions to existence problems always exist from this point of view, they are 
just presheaves rather than genuine objects.

It occurs to me that we could probably do this entire construction for a 
monoidal category, which seems like it should give the definition of a 
[promonoidal category](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/promonoidal+category),
or any other adjunction plus structure set up.</content><author><name>Jason Schuchardt</name></author><summary type="html">Letâ€™s recall the definition of a category enriched in a monoidal category V.\calV.V.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Extending 2-variable adjunctions to diagram categories</title><link href="https://math.ucla.edu/~jasonsch/category%20theory/adjunctions/math/2020/09/24/extending-2-variable-adjunctions-to-diagram-categories.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Extending 2-variable adjunctions to diagram categories" /><published>2020-09-24T18:58:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-09-24T18:58:00-07:00</updated><id>https://math.ucla.edu/~jasonsch/category%20theory/adjunctions/math/2020/09/24/extending-2-variable-adjunctions-to-diagram-categories</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://math.ucla.edu/~jasonsch/category%20theory/adjunctions/math/2020/09/24/extending-2-variable-adjunctions-to-diagram-categories.html">We'd like to understand the following proposition, due (as near as I can tell) to Quillen
in *Homotopical Algebra*:

{: .proposition .math-quote }
&gt; **Proposition**{: .math-header } 
  If $$\calC$$ is a category, then the category of simplicial $$\calC$$-objects is
  enriched, tensored, and cotensored over $$\sSet$$.

In fact, this is a special case of the following proposition

{: .proposition .math-quote }
&gt; **Proposition**{:.math-header }
&gt; If $$-\otimes- : \calC\times \calD\to \calE$$ forms a 2-variable adjunction with 
&gt; $$[-,-] : \calC^\op\times\calE \to \calD$$ and $$\{-,-\} : \calD^\op\times \calE\to \calC$$,
&gt; $$I$$ is a small category, and $$\calC$$ and $$\calD$$ are complete and cocomplete, then there is a 
&gt; 2-variable adjunction $$-\widehat{\otimes} - : \calC^I \times \calD^I \to \calE^I$$, with left and right adjoints 
&gt; $$\widehat{[-,-]}$$ and $$\widehat{\{-,-\}}$$ respectively, defined by the following formulae, 
&gt; where $$F:I\to \calC$$, $$G:I\to\calD$$, $$H:I\to \calE$$:
&gt; 
&gt; $$
&gt; F\widehat{\otimes}G =

*Proof.*

The proof is a standard exercise in manipulating ends, we'll give the natural isomorphism for $$\widehat{\otimes}$$ 
and $$\widehat{[-,-]}$$, since the other natural isomorphism is the symmetric.

The result itself is fairly mundane to prove, but the ideas 
behind it and the consequences are quite interesting.

## Some Consequences

Let's first observe some corollaries.

{: .corollary .math-quote }
&gt; **Corollary**{:.math-header } 
  (a) If $$\calV$$ is closed (symmetric) monoidal, complete,
      and cocomplete, then 
      $$\calV^I$$ is also closed (symmetric) monoidal.
  (b) $$\sSet$$ is closed symmetric
      monoidal.
  (c) If $$\calC$$ is $$\calV$$-enriched, tensored, and 
      cotensored, complete and cocomplete as an ordinary 
      category, and $$\calV$$ is as in (a), then 
      $$\calC^I$$ is $$\calV^I$$-enriched, tensored, and 
      cotensored.
  (d) If $$\calC$$ is complete and cocomplete, then 
      $$\calC^{\Delta^\op}$$ is $$\sSet$$-enriched, tensored,
      and cotensored.

*Proof.* 

(a) Since the multiplication on the functor category is 
the pointwise tensor product, it's easy to check that we get 
monoidal structure natural isomorphisms on the functor 
category.

(b) This follows from (a), since $$\sSet=\Set^{\Delta^\op}$$.

(c) Directly analagous to (a), since being enriched, tensored,
and cotensored can be expressed as there being a tensor
$$\calV\times \calC \to \calC$$, 
which has appropriate unitality and associativity isomorphisms
which are compatible with those of the monoidal structure on 
$$\calV$$, and admitting the appropriate adjoints to form a 
2-variable adjunction. 

(d) Follows from (c) in exactly the same manner as (a).
We note that the tensor product of a simplicial set $$K_\bullet$$ and 
a simplicial object $$C_\bullet$$ is given by 

$$(K_\bullet\otimes C_\bullet)_n = K_n\otimes C_n,$$

the hom simplicial set between simplicial objects $$C_\bullet$$
and $$D_\bullet$$ is given by 

$$\underline{[\Delta^\op,\calC]}(C_\bullet,D_\bullet)_n
= [\Delta^\op,\calC](\Delta^n \otimes C_\bullet, D_\bullet),$$

and the cotensor of a simplicial set $$K_\bullet$$ with a 
simplicial object $$C_\bullet$$ is given by 

$$[K_\bullet,C_\bullet]_n = \int_{m\in \Delta^\op} 
[\Delta^n_m\times K_m, C_m].$$


## Some Thoughts and Observations

Firstly, we can exploit the symmetry of 2-variable adjunctions to get 2-variable adjunctions
$$(\calC^\op)^I\times \calE^I \to \calD^I$$ given by 
$$(F,H)\mapsto [F-,H-]$$
and $$(\calD^\op)^I\times \calE^I\to \calC^I$$ given by 
$$(G,H)\mapsto \{G-,H-\}$$. 
The left mapping adjoint in these adjunctions gives us 2-variable adjunctions 
$$\calC^{I^\op}\times \calD^I\to\calE^I$$
and 
$$\calD^{I^\op}\times \calC^I\to \calE^I.$$

In particular, this should give us a simplicial enrichment on the category of cosimplicial
objects. 

The first functor defined is the cotensor, $$[K_\bullet,C_\bullet]_n=[K_n,C_n],$$ as described above, since it is of the 
form $$\sSet^\op\times \calC^\Delta\to \calC^\Delta$$. By symmetry, we can view it as 
a tensor for the purposes of the proposition above. When we think of $$[-,-]:\Set^\op \times\calC \to \calC$$ as the tensor, then 
the right mapping adjoint is of the form $$\calC^\op\times \calC\to \Set^\op$$, which is equivalent to 
$$\calC\times \calC^\op\to\Set .$$  Thus the right mapping adjoint should be given by $$\calC^\op :\calC\times\calC^\op\to \Set.$$
The right mapping adjoint of the cotensor of simplicial objects will thus be of the form 
$$(\calC^\Delta)^\op\times \calC^\Delta \to (\Set^\op)^\Delta \simeq \sSet^\op,$$ and be computed by 

$$(F,G)\mapsto \int^{m\in\Delta} \calC^\op([\Delta^{-}_{m},Fm],Gm),$$

where the end should have become a coend, since we swapped $$\Set^\op$$ with $$\Set$$, but it's going to need to turn back into an end for 
the final formula,
and I can't figure out where the calculation went wrong.
Then (identifying the functor with its opposite) this is
of the form 
$$\calC^\Delta\times(\calC^\Delta)^\op\to \sSet.$$
Note that the arguments to the right mapping functor are reversed from what we expect for the enriched hom functor. Swapping these
gives the formula:

$$
\underline{\calC^\Delta}(F,G)_n = \int_{m\in \Delta} \calC(Fm, [\Delta^n_m,Gm]).
$$

As a quick check, computing

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sSet(K_\bullet,\underline{\calC^\Delta}(F,G)_\bullet)
&amp;\simeq 
\int_{n\in\Delta^\op}\int_{m\in\Delta} \Set(K_n,\calC(Fm,[\Delta^n_m,Gm]))
\\
&amp;\simeq 
\int_{n\in\Delta^\op}\int_{m\in\Delta} \Set(\Delta^{n_m},\calC(Fm,[K_n,Gm]))
\\
&amp;\simeq 
\int_{n\in\Delta^\op}\calC(Fn,[K_n,Gn])
\\
&amp;\simeq 
\calC^{\Delta^\op}(F_\bullet,[K_\bullet,G_\bullet]),
\\
\end{aligned}
$$

as required.

It turns out that we've recovered the construction of the simplicial enriching on cosimplicial objects
described by $$n$$Lab [here](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/simplicial+object#simplicial_enrichment), which
we obtain by regarding the category of cosimplicial objects in $$\calC$$ as the opposite of the 
category of simplicial objects in $$\calC^\op.$$

We can compute the hom simplicial sets of the construction on $$n$$Lab as well to verify this. We get

$$
\underline{\calC^\Delta}(F,G)_n = 
\int_{m\in\Delta}\calC^\op([\Delta^n_m,Gm],Fm)=
\int_{m\in \Delta} \calC(Fm, [\Delta^n_m,Gm]).
