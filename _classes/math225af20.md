The main references for this course as I understand them are the following:

1. For review of multivariable calculus, chapters 1-3 of Michael Spivak's *Calculus on Manifolds*.
2. The main reference should be John Lee's 
   [*Introduction to Smooth Manifolds*](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4419-9982-5){: target="_blank"}.
   If you are on the UCLA network, you should be able to download a free pdf copy of the book,
   since UCLA has a SpringerLink subscription. If you are not at UCLA right now, you can still 
   access the UCLA network by 
   [using a VPN](https://www.it.ucla.edu/it-support-center/services/virtual-private-network-vpn-clients){: target="_blank"}.
3. Professor Honda's course notes, which can be accessed from 
   [his website](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~honda/Math%20225A%20fall%202020%20syllabus.html){: target="_blank"}.

Zoom links can be found on the CCLE in the [Discussion Links & Materials section](https://ccle.ucla.edu/course/view/20F-MATH225A-1?section=1)
