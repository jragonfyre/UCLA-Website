summary: |
  Leibniz tensors of morphisms are an example of extending 2-variable adjunctions 
  to diagram categories. Specifically we extend a 2-variable adjunction to the arrow category.
  This is also related to lifting properties in category theory and homotopy theory.

Recall from [this post]({% link _posts/2020-09-24-extending-2-variable-adjunctions-to-diagram-categories.md | relative_url %}) that if $$\otimes : \calC\times\calD\to \calE$$ is a 2-variable adjunction, then 
we have a 2-variable adjunction of diagram categories
