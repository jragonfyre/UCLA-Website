    This is the first class in the graduate Geometry and Topology Qualifying Exam sequence. 
    The class generally covers:
    
    - Differentiable manifolds and smooth maps
    - Vector bundles, like the tangent and cotangent bundles
    - Differential forms
    - Integration of differential forms, including Stokes' theorem and de Rham cohomology
    - Vector fields, distributions, and Frobenius' theorem.
