    We show that the Nullstellensatzian (a generalization of algebraically closed) 
    Tambara functors are precisely those coinduced from ordinary 
    algebraically closed fields. In the process we also give conditions for functors to 
    preserve Nullstellensatzian objects.

    From an undergraduate summer research project. 
    We studied triangulations of simplices for which Richard Stanley's local $$h$$-polynomial 
    vanishes, and gave a recursive enumeration of all such subdivisions of the 3-simplex, $$\Delta^3.$$
